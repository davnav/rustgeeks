## Welcome to Rust Geeks page

Here we will go through some of the Rust examples and will try to solve some computer/SDE interview questions or Problems in rust programming language

### Catergories

The problems/algorithms can be Easy,Medium or Hard. If you are newbie to programming , you might have noticed most of the schools/colleges start with "C Programming " language.

But as an alternative , I would reccommend, start with Rust programming language. As you all know C was early computer language and created at 1989. Computer programming languages were evolving over the years.So in a way we can say Rust programming languages evolved after 30 years programming language researches. 
So its better to start with Rust programming language if you are beginning. But you can learn C/other languages also.

Having said this we will start with some easy Rust examples.
I would recommend you to read through the https://doc.rust-lang.org/ as a prerequisite. But we will try to explain the concepts and solutions  when we come across each problems in the coming posts.
